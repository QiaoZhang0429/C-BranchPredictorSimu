CUSTOM APPROACH DETAIL

I combined the techniques of gshare and tournament together. In other words, the local predictor remains the same as tournament while the global predictor and choice predictor adopt the gshare mechanism.

I have also tried the skew method and the bi-mode method described in the YAGS paper.

ANALYSIS

From the result chart above, we can see that tournament is better than gshare. Generally speaking, gshare is better than simple global predictor. Thus the custom which combines them together outperforms both tournament and gshare under similar size restrictions, whose average misprediction rate is much lower. We can also conclude that the more dynamic branch information we use, the better prediction accuracy would be. Thus we could slightly increase the size of custom BHT and PHT to achieve better performance.
